Repository for the trial

Hello everyone,

I am from Guatemala.  I have been living as an expatriate for 20 years.  I left my country and I moved to the USA,  in the north of New Jersey.  I lived with my two older children and husband for five years in a little town called Hackettstown.  Then, my husband was asked to move to Panama.  We moved when my youngest son was only one month old.  We spent 11 years in Panama, a place that embrace us with its culture, its sceneries and specially its people.  On 2015 my husband got a position in Geneva, Switzerland.  I was not ready to move again and we both decided to give it a try.  My husband moved to Geneva by himself, me and the children stayed in Panama until he assured his position in his new job.  In 2016, I moved with my youngest son to Switizerland.  We left my oldest daughter in Panama, finishing her medical school.
